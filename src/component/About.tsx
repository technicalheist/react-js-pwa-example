                    What started as a tiff over property quickly escalated to murder. And a whole unknown side of wrestler Sushil Kumar came out. Known for his polite nature, this side of Kumar came out as a shock to many â€“ that a man like him could be accused of murder. Well, the evidence rarely lies. What happened on May 4 was no less than a scene out of a nightmare. A brawl between two groups, and one person ends up losing his life. After being on a run for over 3 weeks, Kumar and Ajay Sherawat (one of the other main accused) were finally caught. Ironically, it was World Wrestling Day when he was arrested.
